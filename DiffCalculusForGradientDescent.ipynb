    "### What Derivative of a function really is\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fundamental defination of **Derivative** can be stated as — derivative measures the steepness of the graph of a function at some particular point on the graph. Thus, the derivative of a function is a slope at a particular point. Strictly speaking, curves don’t have slope, so we use the slope of the tangent line at a particular point on the curve. That also means that it is a ratio of change in the value of the function (dependent variable) to the change in the independent variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "Take a note in the above image, when Δx approaches 0, the secant line become Tangent at x0 and derivative of the function representing the above graph gives the slope of the tangent line at x0.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we define the derivative of the function f(x) at the point x0, as the limit of the the slope as Δx approaches zero:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the essential idea in differential calculus is about approximating non-linear objects by linear ones. And we already saw, that a tangent line at a point is the best linear approximation to the curve near that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now quickly visualize the above concept — We will see later that by the rules of Differential Calculus (Power Rule) **“The derivative of x² is 2x” which** means **“At every point, we are changing by a speed of 2x** (twice the current x-position)”.\n",
    "\n",
    "And below is the graph of a function f(x) = x². As you can see just looking at the graph y is changing at double the rate of x. Which is what derivative measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://imgur.com/pFwi5KA.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Derivative can also be intutively understood as representing rate of change.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the most simplest real world example of Velocity, which is defined as the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. And Displacement here is a function of _time and_ the dependent variable and the independent variable is “time”. Now t_he_ function has been plotted on a graph. And now we’ll see that the concept of velocity and slope of a curve are connected by the same mathematical definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Velocity is the change in displacement, and so we can think of the ratio as a rate of change of displacement with the rate of change of time to be the derivative of the time function and is called the Velocity.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A derivative of a function is a representation of the rate of change of one variable in relation to another at a given point on a function. The slope describes the steepness of a line as a relationship between the change in y-values for a change in the x-values. However note, afunction does not have a general slope. **We cannot have a slope of** y = x² **at** x = 2**, instead what we can have is the slope of the line tangent to this point.**\n",

    "**From the above figure we can see that the above derivative formulae expresses the slope of the tangent line as a limit of slopes of secant lines.** The slope of a secant line (line connecting two points on a graph) approaches the derivative when the interval between the points shrinks down to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function f′(_x_) is called the derivative of f, since it is derived from f by the limiting operation. You can think of f′(_x_) as a **“slope-producing function”** in the sense that the value of f′(_x_) at x = x0 is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f at x = x0 .\n",

    "\n",
    "As Δ_x_ approaches 0, P remains fixed while Q moves along the curve toward P, and the line PQ revolves about P toward its limiting position, the tangent line PT to the curve at P. Thus, **dy/dx** gives the slope of the tangent at P to the curve y = f ( x )_y_=_f_(_x_) .\n",

    "*   **The Difference rule, again just like regular arithmatic** says the derivative of a difference of functions is the difference of their derivatives.\n",
    "*   **The Constant multiple rule** says the derivative of a constant multiplied by a function is the constant multiplied by the derivative of the function.\n",

    "\n",
    "A differentiable function of one real variable is a function whose derivative exists at each point in its domain. As a result, the graph of a differentiable function must have a non-vertical tangent line at each point in its domain, be relatively smooth, and cannot contain any breaks, bends, or cusps.\n",

    "### Gradient Descent Algorithm — The key steps in a nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the value of coefficients (_θ_0​ and _θ_1) randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate the cost function (Mean Squared Error or MSE in short)** — that is, the sum of squared error across all the data points in the training dataset. (The Mathematical form below which we will explore in more detail further down)\n",

    "![](https://imgur.com/jC9MzSg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We identify parameters, (θ0 and θ1 ) in the regression function and we take partial derivatives of MSE with respect to these parameters. Each derived function can tell which way we should tune parameters and by how much.\n",

    "\n",
    "![](https://imgur.com/PY550Hq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Change the value of coefficients (theta (**θ**) values in the above Cost function equation) slightly, say, +1% of its value. This % by which the Coeffiecients are changed for next iteration is called Learning Rate.\n",

    "> The gradient points in the direction of the largest rate of increase of the function, and its magnitude is the slope in that direction. And by the GD-algorithm, if we are at a particular value of θ (representing coefficients of the Linear Regression function) and if we want to move to a new value of θ such that the new loss is less than the current loss then we should move in the direction opposite to the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now calculate MSE again and check whether, by changing the value of coefficients (Theta/**θ** values ) slightly, overall squared error **(Mean Squared Error or MSE)** decreases or increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If overall squared error (MSE) decreases by changing the value of coefficient by +1%, then proceed further in that direction and increase the Coefficient by 1% again. Else, if the MSE increased, then for the next iteration go in the opposite direction i.e. reduce the coefficient by 1%.\n",

    "### How exactly the Minimization is achieved during Gradient Descent by taking Derivative of the Cost the function\n",

    "#### Maxima and Minima\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given dataset, whenever there is a peak in the data, this is a maximum The global maximum is the highest peak in the entire data set, or the largest f(x) value the function can output A local maximum is any peak, when the rate of change switches from positive to negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://imgur.com/Yq5OkR2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And whenever there is a trough in the data, this is a minimum. The global minimum is the lowest trough in the entire data set, or the smallest f(x) value the function can output A local minimum is any trough, when the rate of change switches from negative to positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://imgur.com/mmbdvol.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And the key point to remember is — **The derivative is zero at any local maximum or minimum.** So, one way to find a minimum: set **_f_′(_x_)=0** and solve for x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the MSE (Mean Squared Error) cost function for a Linear Regression model happens to be a convex function, which means that if you pick any two points on the curve, the line segment joining them never crosses the curve. This implies that there are no local minima, just one global minimum. It is also a continuous function with a slope that never changes abruptly. These two facts have a great consequence: Gradient Descent\n",
    "is guaranteed to approach arbitrarily close the global minimum (if you wait long enough and if the learning rate is not too high).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of non-linear neural networks, the loss function is typically non-convex, which requires extra techniques during training.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. For a function f(x), if the first order derivative f′(x) > 0 at each point in an interval (a,b), then the function is said to be a increasing function in (a,b)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, during the Gradient-Descent algorithm, to determine the direction of the next iteration, for an increasing function don’t move in that direction, because in that case I will be moving away from a trough. **In other words, we can decrease f by moving in the direction of the negative gradient.**\n",

    "#### 2. If the first order derivative f′(x) < 0 at each point in an interval (a,b) then the function is said to be decreasing (a,b)\n",

    "So in this case during Gradient-Descent algorithm, keep moving in this direction, since I am getting closer to a trough\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the concept of increasing and decreasing function intuitively think it like this — because we know the derivative is zero or does not exist only at critical points of the function, for all other points where the function exists, it must be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
